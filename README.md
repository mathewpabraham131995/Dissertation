# Dissertation
I conducted an in-depth research study analysing a prominent online campaign in India, where I investigated the discourse on social platform X for manipulation. I leveraged advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) models using Python to translate multi-lingual posts, evaluate sentiments and detect nuanced stances within these complex online discussions. I implemented a novel metric based on relevant research papers to identify manipulation in these digital narratives. I also skillfully created data visualisations that included word clouds and time series graphs that enabled extracting valuable insights from the discourse. This multi-faceted research approach contributed to the understanding of the evolving role of social media in shaping public perceptions and provided a foundation for addressing challenges arising from digital manipulation.
